    <h2>Dialectical Journal - The Hunger Games</h2>
    <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "Instead my hands go to my hairdo, the one area of my body
      my prep team had been told to leave alone. My fingers
      stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully
      arranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and shoes
      on the floor of my train car, never thinking about
      retrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her,
      of home. Now I wish I had." </p>
      <p>
    <strong>Reaction:</strong> [Even though in the earlier part of the story, we see that katniss is so brave so independant, like she volunteer as tribute and feeds her family all by herself.But I think in this quote, we can clearly see the vulnerability in catniss' heart, when she was thorw into a completely new envrionment, to face this horrible game.she want to hold on something that comfort her, something form her past that remind who she is. Also in this quote, we can see that, even after all those things she had been through with her mother. She knew in the bottom of her heart,she still love her. Likewise, this "carefully arranged braids" shows the tenderness and love from her mother.]</p>

    <h2>Dialectical Journal - Coraline</h2>
    <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "And he said that wasn’t brave of him, doing that, just standing there and being stung,” said Coraline to the cat. “It wasn’t brave because he wasn’t scared: it was the only thing he could do. But going back again to get his glasses, when he knew the wasps were there, when he was really scared. That was brave." </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Reaction:</strong> [“He wasn’t scared because he was protecting Coraline.”This shows the love and strength of Coraline’s father. He did what he had to do to keep Coraline safe from danger. Without any hesitation, without any fear. That is  love. Knowing that there is danger out there. Scared, very scared yet still facing it, that is brave.]</p>
